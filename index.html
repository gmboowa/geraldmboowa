        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a scientist dedicated to applying genome sequencing technologies to enhance our understanding of health and diseases globally. My work focuses on addressing key challenges such as pathogen characterization, outbreak investigation, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance, leveraging advancements in data science, genomics, and bioinformatics to generate insights that inform and transform health outcomes worldwide.

As an investigator, I have contributed to various research projects, including multiple grants funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF):

Understanding transmission dynamics and acquisition of antimicrobial resistance in East Africa at referral hospitals and community settings (details here).
Piloting the use of rapid RT-qPCR assays for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in Africa (details here).
Genomic surveillance of Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in Africa (details here).
Additionally, I have worked on an EDCTP-funded project investigating pathogen detection in HIV-infected children with non-malarial febrile illnesses using metagenomic sequencing (details here).

Over the past 15 years, I have combined research and academia. Notably, I collaborated with colleagues at Makerere University in Uganda to introduce Fogarty/NIH-funded bioinformatics graduate training programs aimed at building genomics and research capacity in Africa. I have organized several training programs, mentoring over 800 graduate students and researchers in bioinformatics and genomics through partnerships with institutions such as:

UC Berkeley’s Center for Emerging and Neglected Diseases and the Alliance for Global Health and Science (details here).
H3ABioNet (details here).
Wellcome Advanced Courses (details here).
Africa CDC (view details).
Recently, I contributed to establishing the Makerere University Data Science Research Training (MakDARTA) program to promote evidence-based health innovation and policy development (details here). Within this framework, we applied machine learning to identify AMR determinants from genomic sequence data (details here).

Recent Research Focus: Machine Learning in AMR Prediction
Our team is currently applying machine learning techniques to predict antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacterial pathogens. Recent studies include:

Escherichia coli: Using genomic data to predict resistance phenotypes and identify novel resistance determinants (full study).
Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Leveraging machine learning to enhance resistance prediction and support TB control efforts (full study).
I have significant experience in wet laboratory work, particularly with WHO Risk Groups 2, 3, and 4 pathogens, serving as a biosafety officer and supervisor of a Biosafety Level-3 (BSL-3) laboratory (details here). My transition to bioinformatics has focused on pathogen genome analysis to address microbiological questions related to pathogen typing, genomic characterization, surveillance, and antimicrobial resistance.

My team developed two automated bioinformatics pipelines:

rMAP (Rapid Microbial Analysis and Profiling Pipeline) for microbial genomic analysis (tool features, publication).
HIVDRIVES for HIV drug resistance profiling (details here).
These tools have been recognized in forums such as the ASM Conference on Rapid Applied Microbial NGS (conference details), with one published in the Microbial Genomics Journal (publication).

I received the Young Investigators Award (2020) from the AAAMR and BioMérieux, Inc. (award details). My broader scientific contributions include over 70 peer-reviewed publications (publications) and active collaboration with local, regional, and international researchers.

Currently, I am a bioinformatics scientist at the African Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Data-Intensive Sciences (staff profile) and serve as an external examiner for universities in Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa. I also contribute to Africa CDC's Pathogen Genomics Program, supporting SARS-CoV-2 sequencing efforts and promoting data sharing (details here, data visualization).

My work has driven the creation of a continental pathogen genomic data platform (details here) and facilitated the analysis and publication of 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from across Africa (publication details). Additionally, I have contributed genomic data to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (repository details).
